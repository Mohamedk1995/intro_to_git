# Markdown Cheat Sheet

## Basic Syntax 
This cheat sheet covers some basic Markdown syntax that I have come across.

----
### Heading 
There are typically three headings:
 H1, H2 and H3, the syntax for these are #, ## and ###, respectively.

---
### Bold Text
To write something in Bold text, we use **"insert-text-here"**

---
### Italic
Similarly, when writing text in italic, we use *"insert-text-here"*

---
### Lists
Lists can be either ordered or unordered. The syntax depends on this differentiation. If we would like to create an ordered list, we use a numerical ordering form as such:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

Otherwise, an unordered or bullet point list takes the form:

- First item 
- Second item
- Third item

---
### Code
When we want to denote some text as code, we use `text`.

---
### Links 
we can add hyperlinks for URLs and Email's through using the <> notation, for example, <https://google.com> and <name@website.com>

These links can also be emphasized using the bold connotation seen earlier. For example **<https://google.com>** and **<name@website.com>**

Also, these links can be given titles such as [Google](https://google.com), which simplifies the hyperlink down to a word.

---
### Images
Images can also be added using an exclamation mark (!) before an image link.  ![Picture of sky](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Sunset_Sky_Wallpaper_%285080737981%29.jpg/1200px-Sunset_Sky_Wallpaper_%285080737981%29.jpg)

---
### Copy
The cp command can be used to copy files or directories.

---
### List
Tying ls and clicking return will list everything in the directory you are currently in. 

---
### Directories
The pwd command allows you to identify which directory you are currently working in.

---
The Cd command allows you to change the directory if you are not where you need to be.

### Cat
Cat followed by the markdown file title will print everything included in the markdown file.

---
### Delete files/directories
Rm -r will delete a specific file or directory

---
### Touch
The touch command is used for file creation. It can also be used for updating the access date and or modifying the date of a computer file or directory.

---
### Insert Line 
We can use "---" to insert lines before and after when sectioning various pieces of information, as can be seen, throughout this document.
